# âœ… Day 5: Integration & GitHub API Interaction - Completion Checklist

## **Milestone 1: Combine Parsing & Calculation**
- [x] Integrated the number extraction and Fibonacci computation logic.
- [x] Ensured that extracted numbers are correctly passed to the Fibonacci function.
- [x] Handled cases where no valid numbers are found in the PR description.

## **Milestone 2: Interact with GitHub API**
- [x] Implemented authentication with the GitHub API using a personal access token or GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- [x] Developed functionality to post a comment on a pull request.
  - Used Rustâ€™s `reqwest` crate to send HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
  - Constructed a formatted comment containing extracted numbers and their corresponding Fibonacci values.
  - Ensured correct API endpoint usage for posting comments.

## **Milestone 3: Testing & Verification**
- [x] Successfully tested with a real pull request:
  - Created a test PR and ran the action.
  - Verified that numbers were extracted and Fibonacci values were calculated.
  - Checked that the action posted a comment on the PR with the correct results.
- [x] Handled API errors and edge cases:
  - Implemented error handling for API failures, invalid responses, and authentication issues.
  - Logged relevant information for debugging.

âœ… **Day 5 successfully completed!** The GitHub Action can now extract numbers from PR descriptions, compute Fibonacci sequences, and post results as a comment on the PR. ðŸš€

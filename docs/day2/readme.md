# ‚úÖ Day 2: Minimal Action Implementation - Completion Checklist

## **Milestone 1: Build a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Action in Rust**
- [x] Created a simple Rust program that prints `"Hello, world!"`.
- [x] Ensured the Rust code compiles without errors.

## **Milestone 2: Test the Basic Action**
- [x] Created a GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`).
- [x] Configured the workflow to trigger on pushes to the `master` branch.
- [x] Set up a Rust matrix strategy for `stable`, `beta`, and `nightly` versions.
- [x] Added steps to:
  - [x] Checkout the repository.
  - [x] Update Rust to the specified version.
  - [x] Build the project using `cargo build --verbose`.
  - [x] Run tests using `cargo test --verbose`.
- [x] Verified that the workflow executes successfully in GitHub Actions.

## **Verification**
- [x] Checked GitHub Actions logs to confirm `"Hello, world!"` output.
- [x] Ensured that the build and test steps pass without errors.
- [x] Validated that the workflow runs automatically when code is pushed.

‚úÖ **Day 2 successfully completed!** The Rust action is running in GitHub Actions and is ready for further development. üöÄ
